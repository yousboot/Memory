Memory is a simple, open-source note-taking application designed for minimalism and efficiency. The goal is to provide a straightforward interface for taking and organizing notes without unnecessary features that complicate the experience.

## Why Memory?

When you think about it, almost anything on the web starts with a simple idea: an empty page that holds content. Yet, finding a simple, frictionless note-taking app has been a challenge. Over time, many apps have become bloated with features, making the act of writing down thoughts unnecessarily complex.

Memory was created to solve this problem. It offers a lightweight and intuitive way to organize notes in simple folders, making it easy to record ideas while you work.

## Features

- Simple UI with no unnecessary buttons—just press `<enter>` to submit.
- Folder and note creation using `<enter>`:
  - **New Folder**: Input the folder name and press `<enter>`.
  - **New Note**: Input the title, folder, and subtitle, then press `<enter>`.
- Built-in keyboard shortcuts for a faster workflow:
  - `<Ctrl-s>`: Save edits.
  - `<Ctrl-b>`: Bold selection.
  - `<Ctrl-i>`: Italicize selection.
  - `<Ctrl-u>`: Underline selection.
  - `<Ctrl-h>`: Highlight selection.
- Instant formatting for pasted URLs (YouTube, images, etc.).
- Local media storage under `/notes`.

### Future Features

- IPFS integration for secure note sharing.
- Import & Export notes.
- Folder and note reordering.
- Code formatting & beautification.
- One-click installation package for non-technical users.
